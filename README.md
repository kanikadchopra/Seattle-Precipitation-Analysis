# Seattle-Precipitation-Analysis
Utilized data on Seattle's precipitation from 2014 to generate analysis questions, determine summary statistics, and create functions to deep dive into the data. Used matplotlib to create a histogram after segregating the data by month, and then determining the average precipitation in inches for each month.

## Tools Used:
### Data Analysis: pandas, NumPy
### Data Visualization: matplotlib
### File Exported: csv file

### Steps taken:
1. Created basic questions to understand the data (e.g. how many days with rain, how many days without rain)
2. Developed a function to break down the dates that were in integer forms (e.g. 19990225) into months and days 
3. Created more functions that took the new DataFrames created and determined the monthly average
4. Determined which day had the highest precipitation and which days had the least precipitation
5. Utilized matplotlib to create a histogram and added in axes and title labels to show the monthly precipitation average
6. Created a Series that stored and displayed all the summary statistics from this analysis
