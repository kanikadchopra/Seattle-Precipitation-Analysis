# Seattle-Precipitation-Analysis
Utilized data on Seattle's precipitation from 2014 to generate analysis questions, determine summary statistics, and create functions to deep dive into the data. Used matplotlib to create a histogram after segregating the data by month, and then determining the average precipitation in inches for each month.
